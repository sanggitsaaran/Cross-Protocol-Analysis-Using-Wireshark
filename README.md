# Cross-Protocol-Analysis-Using-Wireshark
This project uses Wireshark to analyze network traffic, focusing on understanding dependencies between protocols, specifically DNS and HTTP. By studying the interaction between DNS and HTTP, we can see how DNS response times impact HTTP requests, providing insights into potential delays in network performance.
